# CodeGrade README

Get instant feedback on your active file's readability!

**Warning**: This extension is still in early development!

## Features

Grades code on the following four criteria (not yet exhaustive):
- Number of comments
- Number of blank lines (vertical space)
- Length of file
- "Width" of file (longest single line)

## Extension Settings

Eventually, the grading rubric will be user-configurable... but not yet.

## Coming Soon

CodeGrade is still in early development; here are some things to look forward to:
- Comment / vertical space grading based on lines-between rather than "dumb" and simple ratios
- Explanations of how to improve the current file's score
- High or low: see where each score falls relative to its scoring range

## Release Notes

### 0.0.1

Initial release of codegrade! Your active file will be graded on the four basic
grading metrics. Hover over the status bar item to see the grading breakdown.

### 0.0.2

Unified rubric and ideal scoring ranges into single object... far less dumb than the old
approach.

Adjusted default scoring (line length is more lenient now).
